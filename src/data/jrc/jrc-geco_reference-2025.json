  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe European Commission’s Global Energy and Climate Outlook 2024 (GECO) provides an ensemble of energy transition scenarios, developed by the Joint Research Centre. Its Reference scenario reflects a continuation of currently legislated and implemented policies only, without incorporating aspirational pledges or long-term strategies. Under this scenario, global CO₂ emissions remain relatively flat in the medium term, with only limited reductions after peaking in the 2020s. The Reference pathway leads to a global temperature increase of approximately 2.6 °C by 2100, significantly above the Paris Agreement goals.\n\n**Core Drivers:**\n\n*Policy:* The Reference pathway assumes no new policies are introduced beyond already legislated measures. However, existing carbon pricing, energy development policies, and technology subsidies continue to play a significant role in shaping pathway projections.\n\n*Demand shifts:* Energy demand continues to grow steadily, driven by economic and population growth, particularly in emerging and developing economies.  Electrification proceeds more slowly and unevenly across sectors and regions, reflecting existing infrastructure and policy baselines. Demand-side transformations (e.g. in transport, heating, or diets) are limited and not systematically supported by policy.\n\n*Technology Costs, Deployment, and Investment:* Technology cost assumptions reflect ongoing learning and cost declines. Ongoing cost declines support the competitiveness of clean energy technology, leading to increased global deployment of solar, wind, batteries, and clean hydrogen. Investment in clean energy rises moderately, but significantly below the levels projected in GECO’s more ambitious pathways. However, fossil fuel fired generation maintains significant market share, with investments in significant new unabated fossil fuel infrastructure continuing in many regions.\n\n#### Application to transition assessment\n\nGECO Reference is predictive pathway based on detailed modeling of current stated policies, market conditions, and technology trends, and provides a valuable base-case projection for benchmarking the impact of future transition impacts in the absence of significant policy or market shifts. As a global integrated assessment model, GECO Reference provides a direct connection between the described pathway and a global temperature outcome. While this allows assessing the ambition of stated targets or plans against a 2.6°C outcome, this high level of implied temperature rise is not applicable for most institutional targets.\n\nDue to its strong focus on modeling existing policy and market trends, the Reference pathway is well-suited to assessing the alignment of corporate targets, plans, and investment pipelines against a conservative forecast of market shifts. Misalignment to the Reference pathway indicates that a company or plan may already be lagging forecast rates of change, potentially exposing them to regulatory risks or declining market share as other segments of the energy sector are encouraged to grow. As Reference does not include aspirational targets or potential future policies, it can be viewed as a conservative projection of potential market dynamics, and plans that exceed the rate of transition forecast in Reference may still be exposed to future risks if new policies or technology shifts occur.\n\nThe inclusion of detailed technology cost and deployment projection makes the Reference pathway a strong candidate for contextualizing the commercial and technical feasibility of transition strategies in the absence of additional policy shifts.\n\nThe Reference pathway provides capacity and generation technology on 5-year increments, using a moderately detailed breakdown of technologies including coal, wind, solar, and battery storage. The pathway provides benchmarks at a range of geographic granularity, including global results, EU-specific results, country-specific results for 24 non-EU countries, and 13 residual regions. These granular benchmarks provide valuable information for assessing specific decarbonization levers and project pipelines within company plans, and can allow temperature alignment assessments within granular geographic scope. Users may wish to supplement country-specific GECO 1.5°C pathway data with bottom-up, country-specific models where available, such as those published by the Philippines Department of Energy.",
