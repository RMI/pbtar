  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) develops reference climate scenarios to help central banks, regulators, and financial institutions assess transition and physical risks associated with climate change. The Current Policies (CP) Scenario represents a continuation of already implemented climate policies as of the scenario base year. It assumes no further policy tightening or realization of unimplemented pledges under the Paris Agreement. This pathway provides a baseline benchmark for assessing the gap between existing policies and the ambition required to meet national commitments. \n\nThis scenario is one of seven scenarios published by NGFS. Note that all NGFS scenarios are produced using three different Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs): REMIND-MAgPIE, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM, and GCAM. These IAMs share the common assumptions that define each scenario, but may offer different projections based on underlying model structure. Technical users may wish to consult NGFS documentation to determine if a specific IAM best fits their applications.\n\nThe Current Policies pathway corresponds to an implied global temperature rise around 3°C by 2100 across all three IAMs, but underlying technology projections vary significantly, with wind and solar achieving 72% of power generated by 2050 in REMIND but only 31% in MESSAGE.\n\n**Core drivers:** The Current Policies pathway is driven by existing energy system policies and gradual cost declines for renewable technologies. \n\n*Policy:* The Current Policies scenario assumes no major strengthening of climate measures. Carbon prices remain at current levels; fossil fuel subsidies persist, and climate regulations evolve slowly. Renewable support policies and efficiency standards continue where already enacted but are not expanded. Policy momentum is uneven across regions. This results in emissions that stabilize or decline modestly in advanced economies but continue rising in aggregate.\n\n*Technology deployment:* Technological progress continues but follows a market-driven rather than policy-driven trajectory. Cost declines in renewables and electrification proceed at the same pace as in other NGFS scenarios, but without strong policy incentives cost differences are reduced and adoption of low-carbon technology remains moderate. Wind and solar experience gradual growth, with fossil fuels remaining prominent. Transport and buildings experience gradual electrification, while cost-driven energy efficiency improvements are modest.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nAs an exploratory scenario based on current legislated policy, the CP scenario provides a baseline reference for evaluating risks in a world of limited policy action. By modeling only existing policies with clear implementation plans, CP offers a conservative projection of market and policy developments in the absence of significant additional climate action. This enables benchmarking of corporate and financial plans against a world where global warming reaches 3°C.\n\nDue to its strong focus on modeling existing policy and market trends, the CP scenario is well-suited to assessing the alignment of corporate targets, plans, and investment pipelines against a conservative forecast of market shifts. Misalignment with the CP scenario pathway indicates that a company or plan may already be lagging forecasted rates of change, potentially exposing them to regulatory risks or declining market share as other segments of the energy sector grow. As CP excludes aspirational pledges such as those modeled in the NDC or Net Zero scenarios, it provides a lower-bound estimate of transition progress. Plans that exceed the rate of transition forecast in the CP scenario may still be exposed to future risks if new policies or technology shifts occur.\n\nThe CP scenario provides detailed information on cost and technology deployment, which can provide valuable context on the technological and commercial feasibility of transition strategies under current policy and market conditions.\n\nThe CP scenario provides five-year and ten-year (depending on IAM and period) projections to 2100 for emissions, energy mix, technology deployment, and macroeconomic indicators at the global and regional level, with country-level results available via a downscaling process. This detailed dataset supports assessment of corporate targets, plan feasibility, and investment pipelines. Due to the use of downscaling, users interested in country-specific benchmarks may wish to supplement with bottom-up country pathways such as those developed by the Philippines Department of Energy.",
