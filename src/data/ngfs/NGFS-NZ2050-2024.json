  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) develops reference climate transition and physical risk scenarios to support financial institutions, regulators, and policymakers in assessing climate-related financial risks. These scenarios provide globally consistent projections of emissions, energy systems, and macroeconomic trends under varying policy and temperature pathways. Their Net Zero 2050 Scenario is a normative, high-ambition global pathway in which the world achieves net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, consistent with limiting warming to below 1.5°C. It assumes immediate and coordinated global policy action, rapid decarbonization across all sectors, and large-scale deployment of clean energy and negative-emission technologies.\n\nNZ2050 represents the most ambitious pathway in the NGFS scenario set. NZ2050 builds on existing and announced policies but introduces stringent emissions limits and rapid technology innovation. Note that all NGFS scenarios are produced using three different Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs): REMIND-MAgPIE, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM, and GCAM. These IAMs share the common assumptions that define each scenario, but may offer different projections based on underlying model structure. Technical users may wish to consult NGFS documentation to determine if a specific IAM best fits their applications. \n\nThe pathway ensures net-zero CO₂ emissions by midcentury, with residual non-CO₂ gases offset through negative-emission technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) and direct air capture (DAC). This results in 1.4°C of cumulative warming in 2100, with a temporary peak temperature rise of 1.7°C. Fossil fuel use declines by roughly 90% by mid-century, with unabated coal nearly eliminated by 2040 and sharp reductions in oil and gas. Global energy demand stabilizes as efficiency gains and electrification offset growth in activity. \n\n**Core drivers:** NZ2050 is driven by comprehensive global policy, rapid deployment of mature and new technology, and large-scale investment.\n\n*Policy:* NZ2050 assumes comprehensive, early policy implementation, including high carbon prices, removal of fossil fuel subsidies, and strict emissions standards. Policies are consistent across major economies, enabling a globally synchronized transition.\n\n*Technology deployment and demand shifts:* Energy demand is relatively stable in the scenario. The scenario features rapid deployment of mature and emerging low-carbon technologies, supported by innovation and declining costs. Key elements include expansion of renewable power, rapid electrification of transport and buildings, phaseout of unabated coal and oil-fueled power generation, and deployment of CCS, DAC, BECCS, and green hydrogen. \n\n*Investment:* NZ2050 projects a large global reallocation of capital, with clean energy and infrastructure investment rising two to four times above current levels. Investment in fossil fuels declines rapidly, while financing expands in renewables, grid infrastructure, transport electrification, and negative-emission technologies.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nNZ2050 is a global, temperature-constrained normative scenario. As such, the pathway provides a direct connection between the described pathway and a below 1.5°C global temperature outcome and is well-suited for science-based target setting and net zero strategy alignment. \n\nAs a normative pathway, NZ2050 models a potential pathway to achieve a target temperature outcome and introduces significant new policies and market shifts. As a result, (mis)alignment to the NZ2050 pathway is less directly connected to regulatory risk or potential shifts in market share, as objectives within the pathway may differ significantly from currently stated jurisdictional goals. NZ2050 provides detailed technology cost and deployment data, which can provide valuable context on the commercial and technological feasibility of corporate transition strategies. Users interested in these applications should be mindful of the strength of NZ2050 policy and technology assumptions and consider supplementing with additional pathways that model a range of different policies and technology developments. \n\nThe NZ2050 dataset provides five-year and ten-year (depending on IAM and period) projections to 2100 for emissions, energy mix, technology deployment at the global and regional level, with country-level results available via a downscaling process. These data support quantitative assessments of transition alignment, investment requirements, and financial exposure under a rapid and coordinated global decarbonization pathway. This national-level information is particularly useful to measure alignment of any company project pipeline with a Net Zero scenario. Due to the use of downscaling, users interested in country-specific benchmarks may wish to supplement with bottom-up country pathways such as those developed by the Philippines Department of Energy.",
