  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) develops reference climate scenarios to help central banks, regulators, and financial institutions assess transition and physical risks associated with climate change. The Delayed Transition (DT) scenario describes a world in which meaningful climate action is postponed until after 2030, followed by a rapid and disorderly policy tightening to meet long-term climate goals. This scenario assumes that governments initially maintain a trajectory close to current policies through the 2020s, with rising emissions and continued dependence on fossil fuels. As climate impacts intensify and policy pressure mounts, an abrupt transition occurs from the 2030s onward, involving steep carbon prices, accelerated technology deployment, and faster-than-planned phaseout of high-emitting assets.\n\nThis scenario is one of seven scenarios published by NGFS. Note that all NGFS scenarios produced using three different Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs): REMIND-MAgPIE, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM, and GCAM. These IAMs share the common assumptions that define each scenario, but may offer different projections based on underlying model structure. Technical users may wish to consult NGFS documentation to determine if a specific IAM best fits their applications.\n\nThe DT scenario corresponds to a late yet forceful transition pathway, limiting global warming to around 1.6-1.7°C by 2100, comparable to NGFS’s Below 2°C Scenario (B2DS), but with higher costs due to the delayed start.\n\n**Core drivers:** The DT pathway is driven by aggressive policy implementation after 2030.\n\n*Policy:* The DT pathway assumes that through 2030, climate policy implementation remains weak, aligned with the Current Policies scenario. Carbon pricing remains modest, fossil fuel subsidies persist in some regions, and low-carbon support policies expand slowly. After 2030, policy tightening becomes abrupt and widespread: carbon prices rise sharply, fossil subsidies are phased out, and stringent emissions standards are introduced across all major sectors. The result is a rapid, coordinated policy ramp-up to close the emissions gap and align with mid-century temperature targets.\n\n*Technology Deployment:* The scenario features two distinct phases of technological change. During the 2020s, low-carbon technology deployment follows existing market and policy trends, with moderate growth in renewables, electrification, and efficiency improvements. After 2030, deployment accelerates dramatically as policy incentives and carbon prices strengthen. This leads to rapid expansion of renewable power, electrification of transport and buildings, accelerated retirement of unabated coal and oil-fired power generation, and massive rollout of carbon capture and storage, direct air capture, green hydrogen, and bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration. \n\n*Investment:* Investment patterns under DT mirror Current Policies in the 2020s, with capital continuing to flow into fossil assets and limited early investment in low-carbon infrastructure. After 2030, investment requirements surge sharply, increasing by roughly a factor of five from 2020 levels to support rapid decarbonization, grid expansion, and carbon removal deployment. The pathway implies significant near-term financial stress as stranded assets emerge and capital shifts suddenly toward clean energy.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThe DT scenario is an exploratory pathway offering a distinct and valuable projection of specific policy implementation dynamics. It allows users to explore the implications of different implementation timelines for otherwise similar policy-driven scenarios. As a global pathway, it provides a direct connection to implied temperature rise, and is suitable for assessing the ambition of targets or strategy against an implied outcome of approximately 1.7°C of warming.\n\nThe DT scenario is most useful as a supplement to other pathways, such as NGFS’s B2DS pathway, to explore how changing implementation timelines impact alignment of transition strategies to different pathways and the potential resulting risks. The DT scenario highlights that alignment to policy-based pathways before 2030 may neglect potential exposure to rapid market shifts brought on by future action. Due to this design, users should be cautious about interpreting short-term alignment to the DT pathway as a positive indicator of transition ambition or limited potential exposure to market shifts. The pathway provides detailed information on cost and technology deployment, which can provide valuable context on the technological and commercial feasibility of transition strategies under the specified policy and market dynamics. \n\nThe NGFS DT dataset provides five-year and ten-year (depending on IAM and period) projections to 2100 for emissions, energy mix, technology deployment, carbon prices, and macroeconomic indicators at the global and regional level, with country-level results available via a downscaling process. This detailed dataset supports assessment of corporate targets, plan feasibility, and investment pipelines. Due to the use of downscaling, users interested in country-specific benchmarks may wish to supplement with bottom-up country pathways such as those developed by the Philippines Department of Energy.",
