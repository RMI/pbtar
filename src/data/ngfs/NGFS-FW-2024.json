  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) develops reference climate scenarios to help central banks, regulators, and financial institutions assess transition and physical risks associated with climate change. The Fragmented World (FW) scenario depicts a future characterized by uneven climate policy implementation, regional divergence, and limited international cooperation. FW assumes a delayed and divergent climate policy response among countries globally, leading to high physical and transition risks. Countries with net zero targets achieve these only partially (80% of the target), while the other countries follow current policies.\n\nThis scenario is one of seven scenarios published by NGFS. Note that all NGFS scenarios are produced using three different Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs): REMIND-MAgPIE, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM, and GCAM. These IAMs share the common assumptions that define each scenario, but may offer different projections based on underlying model structure. Technical users may wish to consult NGFS documentation to determine if a specific IAM best fits their applications.\n\nGlobal mean temperature rise under the FW pathway reaches up to 2.4°C by 2100. This scenario is built from NGFS’ Current Policies Scenario, supplementing it with the inclusion of countries’ 2050 climate targets where available. \n\n#### Core Drivers\n\nThe FW scenario is driven by uneven policy implementation, and regionally diverging investment and deployment of new and mature low-carbon technology\n\n*Policy:* The FW scenario assumes that climate policy ambition varies significantly across regions. Countries with Net Zero pledges implement strong carbon pricing, expand renewables, and adopt stringent emissions standards. Countries without pledges face slower transitions. This lack of policy coordination reduces the effectiveness of global carbon markets and limits technology transfer. The result is a divergent policy landscape: some jurisdictions approach near-zero emissions by 2050, while others maintain high dependence on fossil fuels. Global mitigation progress is therefore slower and costlier, with regional disparities in both transition speed and exposure to climate impacts.\n\n*Technology deployment:* Technological progress continues globally but unfolds unevenly across sectors and regions. Advanced economies accelerate renewable power deployment, electrification, and clean technology innovation, while lagging regions face capital constraints, limited infrastructure, and delayed adoption. Key features include rapid renewable expansion in high-income economies with slower uptake in emerging markets, partial electrification of transport and industry concentrated in high-income countries, continued fossil fuel use in some regions with limited carbon capture and hydrogen deployment, and increasing divergence in energy efficiency between regions. Global renewable generation reaches roughly 60–80% of power supply by 2050, but fossil fuels remain dominant in several large economies.\n\n*Investment:* Investment flows under the FW scenario reflect regional disparities in policy support and financial capacity. Capital deployment toward low-carbon technologies is strong in developed markets but remains constrained in developing economies. Global investment needs are lower than in the Net Zero or Below 2°C pathways but higher than under Current Policies, due to duplication of efforts and inefficiencies from lack of coordination.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThe FW scenario provides a valuable lens for assessing the financial and operational implications of a regionally uneven and disorderly transition. It highlights the risks arising from policy fragmentation—such as market distortions, carbon leakage, and competitive disadvantages—as well as opportunities for differentiation in clean technology leadership and export potential. Large divergences from the Current Policies trajectory indicate regions with substantial climate targets.\n\nDue to its strong policy focus and notably detailed modeling of diverging regional trends, the FW pathway is a useful source of benchmarks for assessing the alignment of company targets and strategies to current stated ambition. Misalignment to the FW pathway can indicate potential risk that a company will fall out of line with future regulatory or economic policy and face declining market share as other segments of the energy sector are encouraged to grow or other regions experience competitive advantages. Conversely, alignment to FW may indicate that a company is well-positioned to take advantage of future policy and market dynamics. The pathway provides detailed information on cost and technology deployment, which can provide valuable context on the technological and commercial feasibility of transition strategies under the specified policy and market dynamics.\n\nThe FW dataset provides five-year and ten-year (depending on IAM and period) projections to 2100 for emissions, energy mix, technology deployment, carbon prices, and macroeconomic indicators at the global and regional level, with country-level results available via a downscaling process. This detailed dataset supports assessment of corporate targets, plan feasibility, and investment pipelines. Due to the use of downscaling, users interested in country-specific benchmarks may wish to supplement with bottom-up country pathways such as those developed by the Philippines Department of Energy.",
