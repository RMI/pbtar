  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) develops reference climate scenarios to help central banks, regulators, and financial institutions assess transition and physical risks associated with climate change. The Below 2°C Scenario (B2DS) is a normative global pathway in which the world limits global warming to below 2°C by 2100 in line with the Paris Agreement objective, projecting approximately 1.8°C temperature rise by 2100. It assumes strong, coordinated climate action beginning this decade, but with slightly slower decarbonization than in the Net Zero 2050 (NZ2050) 1.5°C scenario. \n\nThis scenario is one of seven scenarios published by NGFS. Note that all NGFS scenarios produced using three different Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs): REMIND-MAgPIE, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM, and GCAM. These IAMs share the common assumptions that define each scenario, but may offer different projections based on underlying model structure. Technical users may wish to consult NGFS documentation to determine if a specific IAM best fits their applications.\n\nThe B2DS pathway achieves deep reductions in energy- and process-related CO₂ emissions, while allowing for limited continued use of fossil fuels offset by carbon capture and storage (CCS) and other carbon removal measures. Global CO₂ emissions decline sharply through mid-century and reach net zero by roughly 2070. Non-CO₂ emissions, particularly methane, fall significantly but not completely, requiring partial offsetting through bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) and direct air capture (DAC). Energy demand is either flat or slightly increasing depending on the underlying IAM.\n\n**Core drivers:** B2DS is driven by strong policy, rapid deployment of mature low-carbon technology, and rapidly increasing investment.\n\n*Policy:* B2DS assumes strong coordinated immediate climate policy, with gradually increasing stringency. This includes carbon prices, the removal of fossil fuel subsidies and the tightening of emissions standards across sectors. Countries with net-zero targets at least partially achieve them (80% of target reductions), resulting in a 67% chance of limiting global warming to below 2°C. The policies included in B2DS go beyond current announced governmental pledges. \n\n*Technology deployment:* The Below 2°C pathway relies on accelerated but balanced deployment of mature low-carbon technologies alongside emerging solutions. Key expansion areas include rapid renewable power deployment, widespread electrification of transport and buildings, progressive phaseout of unabated coal and oil-fired power generation, deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS), BECCS, DAC, and hydrogen, and advancements in industrial decarbonization and grid-scale energy storage. The share of renewables in total energy supply rises rapidly, reaching about 70–80% of power generation by 2050, while coal use in primary energy declines by more than 80% relative to 2020 levels.\n\n*Investment:* Transitioning along the B2DS pathway requires a major global increase in energy investment, with investment in low-carbon technology increasing by up to a factor of four from 2020 to 2050 depending on the underlying IAM.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThe Below 2°C Scenario provides a global benchmark for high-ambition climate strategies consistent with the Paris Agreement. As a global pathway, it provides a direct connection to an implied global temperature rise, and is suitable for assessing the ambition of transition targets or strategies. \n\nAs a normative global scenario, B2DS provides a reference for long-term alignment but may not capture region-specific policy feasibility or market conditions. Misalignment to the B2DS pathway can indicate potential future risk that a company would be exposed to future regulatory or policy conditions targeting a ~1.8°C normative outcome, however, misalignment to B2DS does not necessarily imply a company is exposed to current regulatory risk.  \n\nNGFS scenarios provide detailed information on cost and technology deployment, which can provide valuable context on the technological and commercial feasibility of transition strategies under given policy and market conditions. Users interested in these applications should review B2DS policy and technology assumptions and consider supplementing with additional pathways that model a range of different policies and technology developments. \n\nThe NGFS B2DS dataset provides five-year and ten-year (depending on IAM and period) projections to 2100 for emissions, energy mix, technology deployment at the global and regional level, with country-level results available via a downscaling process. These data can support quantitative assessments of transition alignment, capital needs, and financial exposure under the specific policy and market conditions. Due to the use of downscaling, users interested in country-specific benchmarks may wish to supplement with bottom-up country pathways such as those developed by the Philippines Department of Energy.",
