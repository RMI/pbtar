  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) develops reference climate scenarios to help central banks, regulators, and financial institutions assess transition and physical risks associated with climate change. The Low Demand (LD) scenario describes a world in which strong climate policies are combined with major shifts in behavior, energy efficiency, and consumption patterns, resulting in significantly lower energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. This scenario assumes widespread adoption of sustainable lifestyles, efficiency gains across all sectors, and rapid deployment of mature low-carbon technologies. As a result, global energy demand peaks early and declines steadily through the century.\n\nThis scenario is one of seven scenarios published by NGFS. Note that all NGFS scenarios are produced using three different Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs): REMIND-MAgPIE, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM, and GCAM. These IAMs share the common assumptions that define each scenario, but may offer different projections based on underlying model structure. Technical users may wish to consult NGFS documentation to determine if a specific IAM best fits their applications.\n\nThe LD pathway achieves a 1.1°C–1.3°C temperature outcome by 2100, more ambitious than the Net Zero 2050 scenario, and with less reliance on carbon dioxide removal and negative-emission technologies. The scenario assumes an annual final energy demand reduction of 0.4–1.3% depending on IAM. The scenario emphasizes demand-side mitigation, reflecting both behavioral change and systemic efficiency improvements rather than purely supply-side transformation. It is the most ambitious of the pathways published by NGFS.\n\n**Core drivers:** The LD pathway is driven by immediate global policy action, significant demand shifts, and deployment of new and mature low-carbon technology.\n\n*Policy:* The LD scenario assumes strong, coordinated global climate policy supported by robust social and institutional frameworks that promote energy efficiency and behavioral change. Early and consistent policy implementation leads to a smooth and orderly transition. Measures include high and rising carbon prices (though lower than in the Net Zero 2050 pathway), phaseout of fossil fuel subsidies, strict efficiency standards, promotion of circular economy models, and investment in public transit and low-carbon infrastructure. These efforts result in sustained emission reductions and early achievement of many national net-zero goals.\n\n*Technology deployment:* The LD pathway relies on broad deployment of mature low-carbon technologies, reinforced by reduced energy consumption across sectors. Technology development focuses on efficiency, electrification, and decentralization, while reliance on negative-emission technologies (e.g., direct air capture (DAC)) is limited compared with other high-ambition scenarios. Key developments include rapid expansion of renewable power, electrification of transport and buildings, rapid phaseout of fossil fuels, integration of distributed energy resources, and widespread behavioral and systemic changes to reduce energy intensity and energy demand. \n\n*Investment:* The LD scenario requires substantial but more efficient allocation of capital than other high-ambition pathways. Early policy clarity and reduced demand lower overall system investment needs relative to Net Zero 2050. Investments are concentrated in electrification, renewable generation, transmission, and efficiency retrofits, while fossil investments fall sharply. Global low-carbon investment approximately quadruples between 2020 and 2050, with lower cumulative system costs due to reduced energy throughput.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThe Low Demand scenario provides a benchmark for assessing the potential financial, operational, and policy implications of a high-ambition, demand-side transition. It is especially relevant for sectors exposed to changes in consumption patterns, energy intensity, or material demand, such as energy utilities, transport, and manufacturing. As a global economy-wide model, it offers a direct connection to implied temperature rise and is suitable for benchmarking the ambition of plans and strategies against an extremely ambitious outcome of well under 1.5°C of warming. \n\nAlignment with the LD pathway indicates consistency with the most ambitious feasible decarbonization trajectory, emphasizing early action, energy efficiency, and sustainable demand reduction. However, the scenario assumes a level of behavioral and social change that may exceed near-term policy feasibility in many regions. Users interested in assessing the policy alignment or technological and commercial feasibility of corporate transition strategies should consider supplementing with additional pathways that model a range of different policies and technology developments. \n\nThe NGFS Low Demand dataset provides five-year and ten-year (depending on IAM and period) projections to 2100 for emissions, energy mix, technology deployment, carbon prices, and macroeconomic variables at the global and regional level, with country-level results available via a downscaling process. These data support quantitative assessments of portfolio resilience, transition alignment, and exposure to demand-side transformation risks and opportunities. Due to the use of downscaling, users interested in country-specific benchmarks may wish to supplement with bottom-up country pathways such as those developed by the Philippines Department of Energy.",
