  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) develops reference climate scenarios to help central banks, regulators, and financial institutions assess transition and physical risks associated with climate change. The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Scenario represents a policy-based pathway aligned with the implementation of countries’ current NDCs. It reflects the continuation of announced and planned climate policies without assuming additional or stronger measures beyond these commitments. This pathway incorporates targets through 2030, at which point ambition is assumed to be fixed. \n\nThis scenario is one of seven scenarios published by NGFS. Note that all NGFS scenarios produced are using three different Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs): REMIND-MAgPIE, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM, and GCAM. These IAMs share the common assumptions that define each scenario, but may offer different projections based on underlying model structure. Technical users may wish to consult NGFS documentation to determine if a specific IAM best fits their applications.\n\nThe NDC pathway shows greater variation between underlying IAMs than most NGFS pathways due to different interpretations of the core set of input policies. It corresponds to an implied temperature rise of 2-2.5°C by 2100 depending on the choice of IAM, with GCAM forecasting only a 5% reduction in Kyoto greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between 2020 and 2050, while the other IAMs model around a 50% reduction.\n\n**Core drivers:** The NDC scenario is driven by policies derived from current ambition, with increasing investment and deployment of mature low-carbon technology\n\n*Policy:* The NDC scenario assumes the effective implementation of all currently announced and legislated climate policies until 2030. Carbon pricing mechanisms expand modestly; fossil fuel subsidies are partially reduced, and renewable energy policies strengthen incrementally. However, policy coordination remains limited, and ambition varies across regions. After 2030, no additional policy action is introduced, and policy settings remain at their 2030 levels.\n\n*Technology deployment:* Due to the slow increase in carbon price and remaining fossil-fuel subsidies, technology adoption follows a moderate trajectory, with continued diffusion of renewables and electrification, but without the accelerated innovation or large-scale deployment of negative-emission technologies seen in NGFS normative scenarios. This pathway reflects a continuation of present technological and policy trends rather than a transformative shift.\n\n*Investment:* The NDC scenario requires increased but not transformative investment in clean energy infrastructure. Capital reallocation toward low-carbon technologies progresses unevenly, constrained by policy uncertainty and mixed incentives. Investment in fossil fuel supply and infrastructure declines slowly, while renewable and grid investments rise moderately.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThe NDC Scenario provides a central reference for assessing alignment to currently pledged policy frameworks. In this scenario, transition is still ordered but slower than in NGFS’s Net Zero pathway, but physical risks increase significantly over time due to higher warming outcomes. As a global model, the NDC pathway provides a direct connection to implied temperature rise and is suitable for assessing the ambition of transition targets or strategies.\n\nDue to its strong policy focus, the NDC pathway is well-suited to assessing the alignment of corporate targets, plans, and investment pipelines with the stated ambitions of the jurisdictions they operate in. Misalignment to the NDC pathway can indicate potential risk that a company will fall out of line with future regulatory or development policy or face declining market share as other segments of the energy sector are encouraged to grow. Conversely, alignment to NDC may indicate that a company is well-positioned to take advantage of future policy and market dynamics. The NDC pathway is focused on policy developments through 2030, and may not be suitable for long-term risk assessment. \n\nNGFS scenarios provide detailed information on cost and technology deployment, which can provide valuable context on the technological and commercial feasibility of transition strategies under given policy and market conditions.\n\nThe NDC pathway provides five-year and ten-year (depending on IAM and period) projections to 2100 for emissions, energy mix, technology deployment, and macroeconomic indicators at the global and regional level, with country-level results available via a downscaling process. These data enable users to evaluate the degree of alignment of assets, portfolios, or corporate strategies with current national commitments. Due to the use of downscaling, users interested in country-specific benchmarks may wish to supplement with bottom-up country pathways such as those developed by the Philippines Department of Energy.",
