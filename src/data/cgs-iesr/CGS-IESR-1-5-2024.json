  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe 1.5°C-Aligned (1.5°C) scenario from the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR) and the Center for GLobal Sustainability (CGS) represents an ambitious trajectory for Indonesia’s power sector, in line with global 1.5°C ambitions. The scenario comes from a report published by IESR and CGS, “1.5°C-Aligned Coal Power Transition Pathways in Indonesia.” The report contrasts a low-ambition, business-as-usual (BAU) pathway based on the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) of the Just Energy Transition Partnership Indonesia (JETP ID) with a significantly expanded and more ambitious version that builds on the JETP CIPP but aims for 1.5°C alignment. \n\nSpecifically, the 1.5°C pathway expands on policies laid out in the CIPP and highlights additional decarbonization levers for the Indonesian power sector, including on-grid and captive power plants. The trajectory highlighted by this pathway leads to net-zero emissions from the entire Indonesian power sector by 2050.\nThe 1.5°C pathway uses the least-cost optimization approach of the PLEXOS modeling framework. The main decarbonization levers include early retirement of coal power plants, cancellations of preconstruction projects, biomass co-firing, renewable substitution, grid connection of captive plants, and deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS), especially via bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). \n\n#### Core Drivers\n\nThe 1.5°C pathway is primarily driven by normative policy levers, expanded renewables deployment, and new technology deployment.\n\n*Policy:* The 1.5°C pathway builds on the policy measures contained within the CIPP, including policy-supported retirement of on-grid coal-powered generation, caps on power sector emissions, and targets for on-grid renewables deployment. It extends these policies by introducing an explicit net-zero-by-2050 constraint, introducing cancellation of preconstruction coal plants, and extending coal generation interventions to include captive power plants.\n\n*Technology deployment:* The 1.5°C pathway includes significant deployment of renewable generation, replacing the majority of current coal capacity. Renewable generation is supplemented with fuel substitution to incorporate biomass in existing fossil fuel infrastructure. Residual emissions are mitigated through the deployment of CCS and BECCS technology.  \n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThe 1.5°C-aligned scenario provides an ambitious transition pathway based on a normative, plant-level, least-cost optimization that aims to reduce power sector emissions to net zero in 2050. It deploys a set of measures to reduce emissions from both on-grid and captive power plants, including early retirement of coal power plants, cancellations of preconstruction projects, biomass-co-firing, renewable substitution, grid connection of captive plants, and deployment of CCS. As a country-level pathway, the 1.5°C pathway does not model a global temperature rise and should not be used to directly set or measure temperature alignment targets. However, as a detailed projection of aspirational power sector targets, it may be a relevant benchmark for the ambition of company goals and investment plans.\n\nAs a normative, country-level pathway, the 1.5°C pathway provides valuable information for comparing companies to Indonesia-specific trajectories. Misalignment to the 1.5°C pathway may be a useful indicator of potential future risks such as noncompliance with evolving energy policies or reduced competitiveness where low-carbon technologies are prioritized. Because the 1.5°C pathway will require the implementation of additional policies and targets, misalignment does not necessarily imply exposure to current regulatory risk but rather a potential gap in future readiness. \n\nAs compared with alignment to a BAU pathway, alignment to the 1.5°C pathway gives a stronger indication that a company is positioning itself for potential policy and market shifts. However, it can also indicate some level of risk, should such changes not materialize along the timeline anticipated by a company. Due to its limited detail on technology costs, technology deployment projections, and upstream fuel prices, the 1.5°C-aligned scenario has clear limitations for assessing the commercial and technical feasibility of transition strategies.\n\nThe 1.5°C pathway includes 5- to 10-year interval projections for generation and emissions using a moderately detailed breakdown by energy sources such as coal, gas, wind, solar, bioenergy, and geothermal. These are relevant and useful for running market analyses and analyzing specific decarbonization levers and project investment pipelines within company plans. It is one of the few pathways that analyzes both on-grid and captive power plants, which provides an additional level of local context. Due to its country-specific nature, the 1.5°C pathway has limited applicability for companies with diversified operations across multiple geographies, but it offers valuable specificity for companies in Indonesia.",
