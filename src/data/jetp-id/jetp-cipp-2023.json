  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Indonesia JETP Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) outlines a conditional decarbonization pathway for the Indonesian power sector. Developed under the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), it defines the targets, investment requirements, and enabling policies needed to meet Indonesia’s stated energy transition goals. The CIPP is a non-binding strategy document that does not model a global temperature outcome, but it does provide quantitative benchmarks for Indonesia’s transition to a net-zero power system.\n\nThe pathway outlines a rapid pace of power grid transition, with renewables rising to 44% of on-grid generation by 2030. The pathway limits grid emissions to 250 Mt by 2030, with continued significant declines through 2050. \n\n**Core Drivers:** The CIPP pathway is driven primarily by an emissions cap, targeted coal power plant retirement, and large-scale deployment of renewables, supported by declining costs.\n\n*Targets and policies:* A key driver of JETP CIPP’s decarbonization pathway is an emissions cap, combined with a phasedown of coal-fired power generation. The plan models a constraint that limits on-grid emissions to 250 Mt in 2030, reducing to 175 Mt by 2040. Early retirements of coal power play a significant role, with 1.7 GW of capacity phased down by 2040, followed by accelerated retirements from 2045 to 2050. Additionally, a number of fossil fuel–based power plants are retrofitted to run on bioenergy or ammonia instead of coal, and on hydrogen instead of gas.\n\n*Technology costs:* The JETP pathway assumes S-curve cost declines for renewable power. The levelized cost of utility-scale solar PV falls from US$58/MWh in 2022 to around US$40/MWh in 2030 and US$30/MWh in 2050, while onshore wind falls from US$80/MWh in 2022 to around US$55/MWh in 2030 and US$43/MWh in 2050.\n\n*Investment and technology deployment:* The JETP pathway outlines a capital mobilization plan for Indonesia’s power transition. Implementation of the plan requires at least US$97.1 billion between 2023 and 2030, and US$580.3 billion between 2023 and 2050. Transmission expansion to enable the growth of renewables is a core component of this investment, with 14,000 km of lines costing up to US$19.7 billion by 2030. In addition to large-scale deployment of mature transmission and renewables technologies, the CIPP pathway includes retrofit deployment for fossil fuel power plants to incorporate bioenergy and ammonia co-firing (for coal-fired facilities) and hydrogen (for gas-fired facilities).\n\n#### Applications to Transition Assessment\n\nThe CIPP pathway is designed to demonstrate options for an accelerated transition of Indonesia’s energy system, introducing additional interventions and assumptions to reach stated goals. As a country-level pathway, the CIPP pathway does not model a global temperature rise, and therefore it should not be used to directly set or measure temperature alignment targets. However, as a detailed projection of aspirational national goals, it may be a relevant benchmark for the ambition of company targets.\n\nAs a detailed, country-level policy pathway, CIPP provides valuable information for comparing companies to Indonesia-specific trajectories. Misalignment to the CIPP pathway may be a useful indicator of potential future risks such as noncompliance with evolving energy policies or reduced competitiveness where low-carbon technologies are prioritized. Alignment may indicate that a company is strategically positioned to benefit from market shifts. As the CIPP pathway includes measures that have not yet been implemented, misalignment does not necessarily imply exposure to current regulatory risk but rather a potential gap in future readiness.\n\nThe CIPP pathway includes five-year resolution projections for generation and capacity using a moderately detailed breakdown by energy sources including coal, wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal. These are relevant and useful for running market analyses and analyzing specific decarbonization levers and project investment pipelines within company plans. The CIPP pathway is limited to on-grid generation, and users interested in companies with significant captive power assets should be cautious in making direct comparisons. Due to its country-specific nature, the CIPP pathway has limited applicability to companies with diversified operations across multiple geographies, but it offers greater detail and specificity for companies in Indonesia, as compared to global or regional pathways.",
