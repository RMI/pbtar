  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario from the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR) and the University of Maryland (UMD) represents a baseline trajectory of Indonesia’s power sector development. The scenario comes from a report published by IESR and UMD, “1.5°C-Aligned Coal Power Transition Pathways in Indonesia.” The report contrasts a low-ambition, business-as-usual pathway based on the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) of the Just Energy Transition Partnership Indonesia (JETP ID) with a significantly expanded and more ambitious version that builds on the JETP CIPP but aims for 1.5°C alignment. \nSpecifically, the BAU scenario follows the policies on renewable energy expansion and the targets on high-emitting technologies (such as coal power) laid out in the CIPP. Given that the CIPP does not address captive power generation, the BAU assumes an expansion of high-carbon captive assets. The BAU thus highlights some of the limitations of the CIPP and demonstrates that it will be hard for Indonesia to reach net zero if emissions from captive plants are not addressed.\n\nThe BAU covers on-grid and captive power plants. The pathway uses plant-level data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker database to predict future captive coal power plant use. Coal capacity and emissions align with the CIPP report until 2030, and the scenario assumes a 30-year lifetime for any new plants expected after 2030, except in cases of co-firing with biomass.\n\nThe BAU pathway builds on the policy-driven JETP Indonesia CIPP pathway. It reduces on-grid coal power emissions significantly by 2050 from the peak in 2025, but it does less to tackle captive emissions and overall falls short of providing a net-zero or 1.5°C-aligned pathway for Indonesia’s power sector.\n\n#### Core Drivers\n\nThe BAU pathway is primarily driven by new policy measures detailed in the CIPP and continued deployment of renewable generation sources. \n\n*Policy:* The BAU pathway contains policy measures described in the CIPP. These include policy-supported early retirement of on-grid coal power generation via JETP Indonesia, caps for on-grid power sector emissions, and targets for expanding on-grid renewable power generation resources, as well as supporting retrofits for introducing ammonia and biomass as alternate fuels for existing fossil fuel infrastructure. \n\n*Technology deployment:* The BAU pathway projects significant shifts from coal power generation to renewable generation and non-fossil alternate feedstocks. However, captive coal generation remains significant under the BAU pathway, as it is not directly affected by the policy measures in the CIPP. \n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThe Business-as-Usual scenario provides a baseline reference based on Indonesian policies and the CIPP. It anticipates capacity and emissions changes in line with targets that are legislated or clearly articulated in the CIPP, but it includes no further actions beyond that scope. As a country-level pathway, the BAU does not model a global temperature rise and should not be used to directly set or measure temperature alignment targets.\n\nDue to its focus on modeling existing policy and market trends, the BAU pathway is well-suited to assessing the alignment of corporate targets, plans, and investment pipelines against government policies and the related power capacity forecasts. Misalignment to the BAU pathway indicates that a company or plan may already be falling behind forecast rates of change. Given the target to phase down coal by 2050, this could signal an exposure to regulatory risks or declining market share as other segments of the power sector are encouraged to grow, especially around renewable power generation. \n\nThe BAU pathway does not include aspirational targets or potential future policies, which means that it can be viewed as a relatively conservative projection of potential market dynamics contingent on implementation of the CIPP. By extension, company plans that exceed the rate of transition that is forecast in the BAU may still be exposed to future risks if new policies are implemented or technology shifts occur. The BAU provides limited detail on technology costs, technology deployment projections, and upstream fuel prices, which means that it has clear limitations in assessing the commercial and technical feasibility of transition strategies.\n\nThe BAU pathway includes 5- to 10-year interval projections for generation and emissions using a moderately detailed breakdown by energy sources such as coal, gas, wind, solar, bioenergy, and geothermal. These are relevant and useful for running market analyses and analyzing specific decarbonization levers and project investment pipelines within company plans. It is one of the few pathways that analyzes both on-grid and captive power plants, which provides an additional level of local context. Due to its country-specific nature, the BAU pathway has limited applicability to companies with diversified operations across multiple geographies, but it provides valuable specificity for companies in Indonesia.",
