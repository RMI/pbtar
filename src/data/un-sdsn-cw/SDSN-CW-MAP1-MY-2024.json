  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe More Ambitious Policy 1 (MAP1) scenario builds directly on the assumptions of the More Ambitious Policy (MAP) scenario modeled under the ASEAN Green Future (AGF) Phase 2.1 project using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP). While MAP stops new fossil capacity additions after 2030, MAP1 advances further by enforcing early coal phaseout (2025–2030) and full natural gas phaseout (2030–2050). Renewables, storage, and efficiency improvements replace all retiring fossil capacity, driving near-total decarbonization of electricity generation by the early 2040s.\n\nPower sector GHG emissions decline steeply after 2030, reaching nearly zero before 2040. By 2050, emissions remain near zero, compared with 230 MtCO₂e under the Existing Policy scenario. The emissions intensity of electricity generation drops from over 600 gCO₂/kWh in 2019 to nearly zero by 2050. By 2050, renewables supply virtually all generation, emissions intensity approaches zero, and total emissions fall more than 90% below the Existing Policy baseline.\n\n#### Core Drivers\n\n*Policy:* MAP1 incorporates all policy assumptions from the MAP scenario but introduces phaseout measures that drive a complete fossil fuel exit. It enforces coal retirement between 2025 and 2030 and a natural gas phaseout from 2030 to 2050, supported by an accelerated expansion of renewable capacity and strengthened energy efficiency mandates.\n\n*Technology deployment:* All coal units are retired by 2030 and all natural gas plants by 2050. Solar PV (stand-alone and battery-hybrid) becomes the backbone of generation, supported by hydropower, biomass, and biogas. By 2050, renewables reach nearly 100% of total capacity and generation, dominated by solar and hydro.\n\n*Demand shifts and electrification:* End-use electricity demand follows the same macroeconomic and behavioral trajectory as in the MAP scenario. Total electricity demand rises to 300 TWh in 2050, reflecting the combined effects of electrification and efficiency. Electrification accelerates across transport and industry, driven by EV adoption and the replacement of fossil-based industrial processes.\n\n*Efficiency:* While no quantitative information on energy efficiency trends is available for this pathway, the report provides some qualitative information on efficiency measures. Efficiency measures, particularly in the residential and commercial sectors, further constrain demand growth, with 100% penetration of efficient lighting, cooling, and appliances by 2060.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nMAP1 is a normative, near-zero exploratory scenario showing the technological and policy steps required for Malaysia’s power sector to align with a highly ambitious rapid transition. This pathway can be used as a reference for entities aiming to align with a net-zero target consistent with Malaysia’s 2050 goals and shows the potential exposure of coal and gas assets under accelerated policy actions. As a country-level pathway, the MAP1 pathway does not model a global temperature rise and should not be used to directly set or measure temperature alignment targets.\n\nMAP1 does not assess economic, social, or institutional constraints but serves as a technical upper bound on achievable power sector decarbonization using commercially available technologies. As a result, (mis)alignment to MAP1 is less directly connected to regulatory risk or potential shifts in market share, but the pathway provides the most robust signal of alignment to possible future ambition. As MAP1 also explores the rapid and near-total phaseout of unabated coal and gas, it enables a forward-looking assessment of which generation assets would be most exposed to transition risk and potential stranding under a fully decarbonized energy system. Given the strength of the pathway’s assumptions, users interested in assessing the feasibility of corporate transition strategies should supplement MAP1 with additional pathways providing a range of input assumptions.\n\nThe MAP1 pathway models Malaysia’s national power and energy systems to 2050, providing country-level projections for generation and capacity at five-year intervals, with a moderately detailed breakdown by energy source such as solar PV, biomass, coal, and gas. Due to its country-specific nature, the MAP1 pathway has limited applicability to companies with operations across multiple geographies, but it offers greater detail and specificity for companies in Malaysia, as compared to global or regional pathways.",
