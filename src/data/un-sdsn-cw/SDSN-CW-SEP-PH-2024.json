  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Simulated Existing Policy (SEP) scenario models the Philippine power system under the continuation of current policies and investment trajectories as outlined in the Philippine Energy Plan 2023–2050 (PEP). It models the energy transition assuming full implementation of the moratorium on new coal-fired plants, as well as existing renewable energy policies, but just misses renewable energy share targets as natural gas also takes an increasing role in the generation mix. Using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) model, SEP uses a predefined set of capacity additions that follow policy targets and expected investment behavior, instead of allowing the model to pick the lowest cost mix. \n\nThe ASEAN Green Future regional research project is run by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, Climateworks Centre, and local researchers from leading universities. The project develops national policy analysis and near-zero pathways that are meant to provide policy recommendations and support policy makers.\n\n#### Core Drivers\n\nSEP is driven by steady demand growth, moderate efficiency improvements, and the full implementation of existing policy targets. This results in continued reliance on legacy coal and natural gas to maintain system reliability. Renewable energy expands gradually, but emissions remain elevated due to the absence of deeper policy or structural reforms.\n\n*Policies:* The scenario assumes full implementation of existing renewable energy policies in the Philippines, but no new fiscal or regulatory interventions beyond the Philippine PEP. \n\n*Technology:* Coal remains the dominant generation source early in the pathway, peaking before gradually declining as existing plants age out and renewables expand. Renewable energy grows steadily over time, eventually overtaking coal as new solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal capacity is added. Although new solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear plants enter the system, persistent reliance on legacy coal plants constrains deeper decarbonization.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThe SEP scenario serves as a conservative baseline for assessing transition dynamics in the Philippine power sector, reflecting the continuation of existing policies and current market behavior without introducing new climate interventions. SEP provides a benchmark for evaluating whether corporate targets and investment plans are aligned with the pace of change expected under today’s regulatory environment.\n\nGiven its focus on implemented policies rather than aspirational goals, SEP is useful for identifying both laggards and early movers. Companies falling behind the SEP trajectory may already face regulatory or competitiveness risks, while companies planning to move faster than SEP may encounter uncertainty, as the supportive policies and infrastructure needed for rapid transition are not yet in place.",
