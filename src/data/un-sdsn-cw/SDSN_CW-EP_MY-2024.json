  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Existing Policy Pathway models Malaysia’s power and energy systems using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) under the ASEAN Green Future (AGF) project. It reflects current development trends prior to the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), showing continued fossil fuel reliance and moderate renewable energy growth to 2050.\n\nThe Existing Policy Pathway represents a “business-as-usual” policy trajectory, with incremental renewable additions and no new mitigation mechanisms. The scenario applies a Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 (SSP2) baseline, reflecting moderate GDP, population, and technology growth. Fossil generation, particularly natural gas and coal, remains dominant. Renewable capacity grows slowly, mainly from hydropower and solar, with limited wind and biomass deployment. No coal phaseout or carbon pricing is assumed.\n\nWithout new measures, power generation emissions rise to 230 MtCO₂e in 2050. The power sector’s emissions intensity does not decline significantly, indicating sustained dependence on coal and gas. Investment is concentrated in maintaining existing infrastructure, with limited capital for storage, flexibility, or carbon capture. \n\n**Core Drivers:**\n\nThe Existing Policy Pathway is driven primarily by current power development policies, increasing electricity demand, and steady renewable energy deployment.\n\n*Policy:* The Existing Policy Pathway captures the trajectory of policies in place before July 2023, including the Malaysia Renewable Energy Roadmap (MyRER 2021), the Peninsular Malaysia Generation Development Plan (2021–2039), and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP 2016–2025). It excludes the potential impact of the 2023 NETR. The Malaysia Renewable Energy Roadmap and the Generation Development Plan drive modest renewable energy expansion.\n\n*Technology deployment:* Renewable capacity grows slowly, mainly from hydropower and solar, with limited wind and biomass deployment. No coal phaseout or carbon pricing is assumed. By 2050, renewables reach 36% of installed capacity and 30% of generation, while fossil fuels still provide about 70% of electricity.\n\n*Energy efficiency and demand shifts:* Although no quantitative information on energy efficiency trends is available for this pathway, the report provides some qualitative information on efficiency measures. Efficiency standards (e.g., minimum energy performance standards, or MEPS) slow residential demand growth, while EV adoption remains limited (<15% of cars by 2050). Energy intensity improves by roughly 55% relative to 2019 but is offset by economic growth.\n\n#### Applications to Transition Assessment \n\nThe Existing Policy Pathway is a business-as-usual predictive pathway suitable for assessing Malaysia’s short-term regulatory alignment and identifying ambition gaps. As a country-level pathway, the Existing Policy Pathway does not model a global temperature rise and should not be used to directly set or measure temperature alignment targets.\n\nDue to its strong focus on modeling existing policy and market trends, the Existing Policy Pathway is well-suited to assessing the alignment of corporate targets, plans, and investment pipelines against a conservative forecast of country-specific market shifts. Misalignment with the pathway indicates that a company or plan may already be lagging behind forecast rates of change, potentially exposing it to regulatory risks or declining market share as other segments of the energy sector are encouraged to grow. Because the pathway does not include aspirational targets or potential future policies, it can be viewed as a conservative projection of potential market dynamics, and plans that exceed the rate of transition that is forecast in the Existing Policy Pathway may still be exposed to future risks if new policies are introduced or technology shifts occur.\n\nThe Existing Policy Pathway models Malaysia’s national power and energy systems to 2050, providing country-level projections for generation and capacity at 10-year intervals, with a high-level breakdown by energy source such as coal, gas, and renewables. Due to its country-specific nature, the Existing Policy Pathway has limited applicability to companies with operations across multiple geographies, but it offers greater detail and specificity for companies in Malaysia, as compared to global or regional pathways.",
