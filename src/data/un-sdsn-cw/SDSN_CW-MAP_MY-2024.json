  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe More Ambitious Policy (MAP) scenario represents a forward-looking pathway for Malaysia’s power system, modeled after the ASEAN Green Future (AGF) Phase 2.1 project using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP). MAP builds on the same socioeconomic assumptions as the Existing Policy Pathway but includes several additional policy interventions. Specifically, MAP assumes that all new capacity additions after 2030 are renewable, with no new fossil-fuel power generation, and that efficiency measures from the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan are fully implemented and extended. The MAP scenario therefore explores the potential impact of enforcing existing renewable targets and introducing new policy levers to accelerate the transition.\n\nPower sector emissions decline from a projection of roughly 230 MtCO₂e in 2050 under the Existing Policy Pathway to about 90 MtCO₂e in the MAP pathway, corresponding to a 61% reduction. The emissions intensity of electricity generation falls to approximately 135 gCO₂/kWh by 2050. The MAP pathway approaches near-zero emissions but remains short of full decarbonization.\n\n**Core Drivers:**\n\n*Policy:* The MAP scenario builds on the Existing Policy baseline but introduces new policy constraints to accelerate decarbonization. The most significant policy intervention is a moratorium on new fossil fuel generation capacity after 2030. It also strengthens the implementation of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan.\n\n*Technology deployment:* After 2030, all new generation capacity additions are renewable, with hydropower, solar PV, and bioenergy replacing fossil expansion. By 2050, renewables provide approximately 65% of installed capacity and 82% of total generation.\n\n*Efficiency and demand shifts:* Electricity demand increases from 155 TWh in 2019 to 301 TWh by 2050. Electrification expands across sectors, with strong gains in industrial and transport demand due to the rapid adoption of EVs and electric technologies, balanced by higher energy efficiency in buildings and appliances. While no quantitative information on energy efficiency trends is available for this pathway, the report provides some qualitative information on efficiency measures. Residential demand grows modestly as efficient lighting, refrigeration, and air conditioning reach near-universal adoption. These improvements reduce energy intensity by 2050, though total demand continues to rise due to structural economic growth.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThe MAP scenario is an exploratory policy pathway modeling a potential future under expanded policy action in Malaysia’s power sector. It provides a benchmark for companies seeking alignment with accelerated national transition trajectories in Malaysia. As a country-level pathway, the MAP pathway does not model a global temperature rise and should not be used to directly set or measure temperature alignment targets. However, as a detailed projection of aspirational policy targets, it may be a relevant benchmark for the ambition of company targets.\n\nAs a detailed, country-level policy pathway, MAP provides valuable information for comparing companies to Malaysia-specific trajectories. Misalignment to the MAP pathway may be a useful indicator of potential future risks such as noncompliance with evolving energy policies or reduced competitiveness where low-carbon technologies are prioritized. Alignment may indicate that a company is strategically positioned to benefit from market shifts. As the MAP pathway includes aspirational policies and targets that have not yet been implemented, misalignment does not necessarily imply exposure to current regulatory risk but rather a potential gap in future readiness. As compared to alignment with a more limited pathway such as the Existing Policy pathway, MAP alignment gives a stronger indication that a company is keeping pace with national ambition.\n\nThe MAP pathway models Malaysia’s national power and energy systems to 2050, providing country-level projections for generation and capacity at five-year intervals, with a moderately detailed breakdown by energy source such as solar PV, biomass, coal, and gas. Due to its country-specific nature, the MAP pathway has limited applicability to companies with operations across multiple geographies, but it offers greater detail and specificity for companies in Malaysia, as compared to global or regional pathways.",
