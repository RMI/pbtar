  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe MAP1 scenario models a decarbonization pathway in which renewable energy growth is complemented by nuclear generation to manage system reliability and phase out fossil fuels. It integrates aggressive renewable expansion with new nuclear baseload generation, explicitly incorporating the social cost of carbon and other environmental externalities in its optimization function. \n\nThe scenario assumes retirement of all coal and gas plants at 30 years of age, the addition of 4.8 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050, and complete cessation of fossil fuel investments. It balances renewable energy intermittency with nuclear reliability, achieving a stable low-carbon system at optimized cost. The Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP) applies a least-cost optimization that compares all available non-fossil technologies (renewables, nuclear, and battery storage) based on levelized costs, capacity value, operational characteristics, and policy constraints. Under the assumed technology costs, nuclear emerges in the optimized mix because it provides firm capacity at a lower system-wide cost than meeting the same reliability needs solely through large-scale battery deployment, pumped storage expansion, or significant renewable overbuild.\n\nThe ASEAN Green Future regional research project is run by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, Climateworks Centre, and local researchers from leading universities. The project develops national policy analysis and near-zero pathways that are meant to provide policy recommendations and support policy makers.\n\n#### Core Drivers\n\n*Policies:* MAP1 applies accelerated fossil fuel retirement schedules and restricts new fossil investments, while enabling renewable and nuclear technologies to expand under policies intended to support a long-term low-carbon transition.\n\n*Technology mix:* Reliability requirements drive the combined deployment of renewables and nuclear capacity, with nuclear selected as a firm, dispatchable option that reduces the need for more costly system balancing through large-scale storage or renewable overbuild. By 2060, total installed capacity reaches 230 GW, with renewables representing 81% of total capacity and 70% of generation.\n\n*Social cost of carbon and environmental externalities:* Incorporating environmental externalities shifts optimization toward low-carbon assets, eliminating direct generation emissions by 2060. High upfront capital expenditure is offset by reduced fuel imports, improved trade balance, and lower lifetime generation cost. The model internalizes the social cost of carbon by assigning a monetary penalty to high-emitting technologies. By embedding these costs directly into the objective function, the optimization structurally favors zero-carbon technologies and accelerates the shift away from fossil fuels.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThe MAP1 scenario provides a benchmark for assessing an ambitious policy-constrained decarbonization pathway in the Philippine power sector. It embeds least-cost optimization with accelerated fossil phaseout assumptions and serves as a reference point for evaluating the ambition and feasibility of corporate targets and transition plans, noting that a social cost of carbon is incorporated and required to drive the technology shifts observed in this scenario.\n\nThe scenario provides annual projections for capacity, generation, and emissions across a granular technology set, including solar PV, onshore wind, offshore wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass, battery storage, nuclear, natural gas, and coal, which enables benchmarking of company-level project pipelines. This granularity also supports assessment of whether corporate plans adequately reflect technology-specific trends in deployment, system balancing, and emissions reduction potential.",
