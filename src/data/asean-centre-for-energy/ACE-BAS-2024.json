  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe ASEAN Centre for Energy (ACE) acts as the ASEAN energy data center and knowledge hub to provide a knowledge repository for the ASEAN Member States (AMS). The ACE ASEAN Energy Outlook is a publication of several scenarios which highlight some potential energy pathways at ASEAN level.\n\nThe ACE Baseline scenario (BAS) is an exploratory pathway that extrapolates observed historic trends of the ASEAN Member States (AMS) energy systems into the future. It assumes a business-as-usual level of effort and specifically disregards modelling any policy interventions, even existing ones to meet national energy efficiency (EE) and renewable energy (RE) targets. Hence, it also excludes firm plant capacity additions based on power development plans (PDP). The BAS provides a detailed description of a possible future of the ASEAN energy sector, but it does not quantify the probability of this outcome relative to others. The extrapolation of past trends also implies that technology costs remain static and new technologies do not benefit from learning rates.\n\nThe geographic scope of the BAS scenario and the underlying AEO is limited to ASEAN countries. Since this implies the model does not produce any global estimates, the Baseline scenario is not connected with any implied global temperature rise.\n\nWhile the assumptions of this scenario may be considered very conservative, the pathway provides a good benchmark for comparing metrics with other pathways and to understand how much faster the low carbon transition needs to happen.\n\n**Core drivers:**\n\n*Socio-economic trends:* Energy demand is mainly driven by population growth and economic growth, reflecting the reliance on past trends in the energy sector rather than any new interventions.\n\n*Policies:* Policies are not a driver in this pathway, as even legislated targets are not explicitly modelled.\n\n*Energy Efficiency, Electrification, Technology Costs:* Energy efficiency is assumed to remain constant. This is the case across sectors, where efficiency measures across sectors are held fixed at the latest level of input data. Changes at the unit level are also not expected for electrification and technology costs.\n\n*Energy demand growth:* Moderate energy demand growth is fully driven by GDP growth.\n\n*Emissions:* In sum, this leads to more than a doubling of annual emissions in the energy sector in ASEAN until 2050, if no further actions are taken.\n\n#### Application to transition assessment\n\nThe Baseline Scenario developed by the ASEAN Centre for Energy (ACE) serves as an explorative reference, projecting future energy trends based on the continuation of historical patterns. While useful for contextual analysis, this scenario presents several limitations when applied to policy evaluation and corporate risk assessment.\n\nThe Baseline scenario can be used as a conservative case pathway that could be useful for risk analysis under the assumption that existing policies are not properly enforced and the energy sector simply follows past trends. This corresponds to slower change in the market and as such it could be a useful scenario to consider in analysing transition risk.\n\nHowever, the scenario’s conservative nature makes it unsuitable for target setting. It does not reflect the scale of transformation required to meet ASEAN’s climate goals or global net-zero pathways. Therefore, it should not be used as a benchmark for strategic planning or investment decisions aimed at long-term decarbonization.\n\nThe Baseline Scenario provides a regional ASEAN pathway, which limits its applicability for assessing companies with operations concentrated in specific countries. It enables comparisons to the regional average. For analyses that focus on companies with operations in one country only, this may not always be an appropriate reference point, as it may obscure country-specific dynamics, regulatory environments, and market conditions. For regionally operating companies, it can be more appropriate. Where no country specific alternative is available, this regional pathway may still be more appropriate than global ones, although such regional mismatches should always be clarified in any analysis.\n\nFurthermore, the BAS cannot be directly linked to an Implied Temperature Rise (ITR) metric, as it does not model the global energy system and cannot make a statement about how global emissions will evolve.\n\nThe BAS provides benchmark data on 5-year intervals and using a moderately detailed breakdown of specific generation technologies, such as coal, wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal. This level of detail makes it well-suited to assessing specific decarbonization levers and project pipelines within company plans, where a comparison to the regional trend is of interest.",
