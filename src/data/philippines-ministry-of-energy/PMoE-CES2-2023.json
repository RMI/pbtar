  "scenarioOverview": "The CES2 scenario forecasts more than 50% of renewables generation by 2050. Nuclear capacity is added from 2032 to achieve this, along with 50GW of offshore wind, following the NREP. CES2 also targets higher adoption of low carbon solutions: EV penetration of 50% in 2040, a 10% reduction in energy use based on energy efficiency and conservation (EEC) actions, and a 5% biofuel blending. CES1 and CES2 have the same assumptions except on offshore wind buildout.",
  "expertOverview": "CES2 is a policy scenario following the 2022 version of the National Renewables Energy Program (NREP), with a high reliance on offshore wind. As other pathways from the Philippines Department of Energy (PH DoE), it has strong data coverage on investment, job creation and energy supply.\nAs a country-level pathway, the CES2 pathway does not model a global temperature rise and as such, it cannot be used to set or measure temperature aligned targets. It can, however, be used for certain sector specific target setting, such as technology mix targets, as it models medium to long term policy trends. It can also be useful for risk focused (or other commercial) use cases, especially where future company plans are concerned.\nBecause NREP mostly focuses on the power development plan, the CES2 pathway makes significant assumptions to connect the NREP with other sectors and other parts of the power value chain. But this connection with the full power value chain makes it a good resource for dependency mapping for Philippines power utilities, or to better understand the market feasibility of a corporate transition plan.\n\n#### Emissions\nThe CES2 emissions figures contain GHGs including CO2, CH4 and NO2. Emissions are available for the buildings, industry, and transformation sectors which includes power generation and other. Due to the assumptions and scope of the analysis, transformation emissions vary most between scenarios, transportation emissions contribute to the variation because of increased EV use. Total emissions increase by 1.1% a year between 2023 and 2050 in CES2. 73% of the difference to the emissions in the Reference scenario in 2050 comes from transformation sector. Carbon removals are out of scope for this analysis. Transformation emissions are 20% lower than in CES1 scenario. Carbon removals are out of scope for this analysis.\n\n#### Energy demand\nThe scenario provides total final energy consumption, total primary energy supply and total energy supply per fuel and per sector. \n\n#### Supply Assumptions\nBecause the Philippines import most of the fossil fuels they consume, they have a strong exposure to fossil fuel price changes in international markets. Investments in upstream fossil fuels are constant across scenarios.\nThe increase in biofuel blending to 5% reduces the Philippinesâ€™ dependency on international oil prices. This scenario does not foresee LNG imports.\nCoal use significantly declines:\n* in industrial process use, a 9% decline occurs due to efficiency gains.\n* in power generation, coal use declines due to wind and solar capacity build out.\nCoal related emissions fall by 15% in CES2, while they plateau in CES1.\n\n#### Demand Shifts\nPower generation is assumed to increase by 5% a year in the Philippines.\nIn addition, the scenario assumed an EV penetration of 50% in 2040, and energy efficiency and conservation effort brought to 10% in 2040-2050.\nThis is a caveat of the scenario. The power demand forecast is assumed to be constant across all PH DoE scenarios, although in the CES scenarios the shift towards EV is more pronounced and should result in an increased electricity demand.\n\n#### Policies\nCapacity additions follow the updated NREP. They include nuclear power additions from 2032 and 50GW of Offshore Wind Power by 2050, instead of 19GW for CES1.\n\n#### Technology Costs\nThe CES2 scenario does not disclose any information on technology costs. It is possible to derive the cost of capital based on investments and added capacity, but deriving any further information, such as the LCOE, would require external assumptions.\n\n#### Technology deployment\nRenewables represent 70% of total power generation in 2050, led by offshore wind representing 42%. Solar now represents only 11% and onshore wind 7% of total power generation, far from CES1 level. Renewables share was 24% in 2023.\nRenewables generation represents only 65% in CES1 which bridges the gap to the 70% of CES2 mostly with gas-fired power.\n\n#### Investment needs\nTotal investment requirement in the energy sector is 570 Bn USD until 2050, 65 Bn USD more than in CES1. This figure includes upstream (fossil fuel extraction), downstream (oil depots and terminals, LNG terminals, EV charging stations), and power generation investment.\nInvestment is available for the period 2023-2028 and 2029-2050, with a breakdown by technology type.\nRegarding power generation investment, figures are available for coal, oil, gas, battery storage, renewables and other. Renewables investment represents 71% of the power generation investments in the period 2023-2050. Total power generation investment only covers construction of new power capacity.\n\n#### Infrastructure requirement\nThe PH DoE provides a list of transmission projects, with a percentage completion, and a completion target date. Those transmission projects follow the Transmission Development Plan (TDP) 2022-2040.\n\n#### Sensitivity analysis\nCES1 and CES2 are scenario relying on the same assumptions with a sensitive analysis on offshore wind availability.",
