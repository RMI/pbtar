  "scenarioOverview": "The Philippines Department of Energy Reference scenario follows current development trends and strategies. It includes existing plants and committed power projects and WESM-registered capacities as of May 2023. It targets 35% of renewable electricity in 2030 and 50% by 2050.\nIt aims for an energy intensity reduction consistent with regional targets: a 10% EV adoption rate by 2040, stable biofuel blending (2%) and a 5% reduction in energy use based on energy efficiency and conservation (EEC) actions.",
  "expertOverview": "The Reference scenario is a power sector pathway for the Philippines based on present development trends and strategies. This policy pathway has strong data point coverage on investment, job creation and energy supply and some quantitative insights on the direction of the Philippines transition based on current trends. As a country-level pathway, the Reference scenario does not model a global temperature rise and as such, it cannot be used to set or measure temperature aligned targets. For sector specific target setting, it may still not be ideal, as it does not model medium to long term policy trends. However, it can be useful for risk focused (or other commercial) use cases, especially when the emphasis is on current actions. The Reference scenario makes significant power market assumptions to connect power generation with other sectors and other parts of the power value chain. But this connection with the full power value chain makes it a good resource for dependency mapping for Philippines power utilities, or to better understand the market feasibility of a corporate transition plan.\n\n#### Emissions\nThe emissions figures contain GHGs including CO2, CH4 and NO2. Emissions are available for the buildings, industry, and transformation sectors which includes power generation and other. Due to the assumptions and scope of the analysis, transformation emissions vary most between scenarios. Total emissions increased by 2.5% a year between 2023 and 2050 in Reference scenario. Carbon removals are out of scope for this analysis.\n\n#### Energy demand\nThe scenario provides total final energy consumption, total primary energy supply and total energy supply per fuel and per sector. \n\n#### Supply Assumptions\nBecause Philippines imports most of their fossil fuel they consume, they have a strong exposure to fossil fuel price changes in international market. Investments in upstream fossil fuels is constant across scenarios.\nThe Reference scenario also shows some LNG imports in the short term, starting in 2023 with the projected commercial operation of seven LNG projects.\nSimilarly, the scenario plans some investment in oil import terminals.\nThe coal moratorium prevents the addition of new coal capacity in the power sector, except the one in the pipeline. Coal related emissions continue to rise until 2050.\n\n#### Demand Shifts\nPower generation demand increases by 5% annually. This is a common assumption for all scenarios published by the PH DoE.\n\n#### Policies\nThe Reference scenario follows existing policies and the development trends and strategies based on what companies are planning now.\n\n#### Technology Costs\nThe Reference scenario does not disclose any information on technology costs. It is possible to derive the cost of capital based on investments and added capacity, but deriving any further information, such as the LCOE, would require external assumptions.\n\n#### Technology deployment\nThe Reference scenario assumes 35% renewables share in 2030 and 50% renewables share in 2050, from a 24% share in 2023. This increase is mostly due to solar and onshore wind expansion. \n\n#### Investment needs\nTotal investment requirements in the energy sector until 2050 are 357 billion USD, for upstream (fossil fuel extraction), downstream (Oil depot and terminal, LNG Terminal, EV charging station) and power generation. Investment figures are available per technology type for each part of the value chain for the period 2023-2028 and 2029-2050.\nIn the power sector, investment is available for coal, oil, gas, battery storage, renewables and other. Renewables investment represents 75% of total power investment in the period 2023-2050. Total investment for the power sector only covers construction of new power capacity but it does not include investments in the power grid.\n\n#### Infrastructure requirement\nThe PH Department of Energy provides a list of transmission projects, with a percentage completion, and a completion target date. Those transmission projects follow the Transmission Development Plan (TDP) 2022-2040.\n\n#### Sensitivity analysis\nNo sensitivity analysis is done in this baseline scenario.",
