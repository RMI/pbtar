    "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario is a normative 1.5 aligned pathway, outlining how the global energy sector can reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. It assumes that advanced economies achieve net zero earlier (by mid 2040s), with emerging markets following by 2050. As a normative pathway, the NZE provides a detailed description of an achievable way to reach a potentially desirable future state, but it does not attempt to predict which policies or outcomes are most probable. The NZE pathway corresponds to a 50% probability of 1.5°C of warming by 2100. This is a lower outcome than the IEA’s Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), with a 50% probability of 1.7°C of warming by 2100 and the 50% probability of 2.4°C of warming projected by the IEA’s least ambitious explorative scenario (STEPS).\n\n**Core drivers:**\n\n*Policies:* A carbon price is introduced in all regions by 2030, with prices rising to USD$250 per tCO2 in advanced economies, and USD$200 in major emerging markets by 2050 applied to power, industry, and transport. Additionally, fossil-fuel subsidies are largely removed by 2030. \n\n*Technology costs:* The IEA NZE pathway assumes an S-curve trajectory of cost decline, with rapid early reductions as deployment scales up, followed by gradual flattening. This pattern applies across most renewables and transition technologies, including solar PV, offshore wind, battery EVs, and hydrogen fuel cells.\n\n*Technology deployment and phase down:* The IEA NZE achieved its 1.5°C pathway primarily through the rapid deployment of clean technology. For instance, renewable energy capacity, led by solar PV and wind, approximately triples between 2023 and 2030, and reaches nearly 90% of global electricity by 2050. EVs reach account for approximately 60% of new car sales by 2030 and rise to nearly 2 billion vehicles globally by 2050, about 85% of the global fleet. Additionally, CCUS scales from 40Mt in 2023 to 1Gt in 2030, and just under 6Gt in 2050. This rapid expansion of clean technologies enables the peak of unabated fossil-fuel demand before 2030 and its subsequent decline by about 80% by 2050, marking the global phase down of coal, oil, and gas. \n\n#### Applications to Transition Assessment\n\nIEA NZE is a global, temperature constrained normative scenario.\n\nAs such, the NZE provides a direct connection between the described pathway and a global temperature outcome. It is well-suited for science-based target setting and net zero strategy alignment. It can be useful for risk assessment as well, since misalignment with NZE indicates misalignment with a 1.5°C world. This can imply potential exposure to market disruptions and stranded asset risk as economies advance towards net zero. It is one of the most widely-used pathways to benchmark metrics against a 1.5°C temperature rise.\n\nHowever, as NZE is a global pathway, it is not ideal for assessing national or regional dynamics and assessments at that granular geographic level may need to be complemented by adding regional pathways to capture more granular policy and market dynamics. In general, the rather broad strokes policy assumptions made in the NZE scenario do not position it as a prime candidate for policy alignment analysis. Usually, explorative pathways at regional levels will be more appropriate for that.\n\nThe NZE provides benchmark data on 5 and 10 year intervals and using a moderately detailed breakdown of specific generation technologies, such as coal, onshore wind, offshore wind, solar PV, and geothermal. This level of detail makes it well-suited to assessing specific decarbonization levers. However, NZE provides data only at the global level. This limits its suitability for assessing companies which have operations concentrated in one or few countries, which may not be the best benchmark for policy related questions and assessing project pipelines within company plans, at least where companies operate in more national or regional contexts.",
