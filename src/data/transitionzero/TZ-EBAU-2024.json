  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Enhanced Business-as-Usual (EBAU) scenario extends TransitionZero’s Business-as-Usual (BAU) model. It is part of the TZ-APG v1 model of the ASEAN region’s power system, built on the PyPSA modeling framework. EBAU expands BAU by enabling upgrades to existing grid infrastructure while keeping the same geographic configuration. This pathway examines to what extent operational efficiencies and system cost improvements can be achieved simply by strengthening current lines rather than building new ones. The model assumes that the capacity of each interconnector can be optimized to meet power flows at least cost while adhering to national targets. \n\nThis scenario provides a dynamic but infrastructure-limited evolution of ASEAN’s grid. It is not a transformative decarbonization pathway but an incremental improvement scenario, in which policymakers enhance reliability and flexibility through modest investment. In practice, this could represent coordinated reinforcement projects under the ASEAN Interconnection Masterplan Study (AIMS) or bilateral expansions of existing corridors.\n\nTotal installed capacity and generation in 2035 remain almost identical across all TZ-APG pathways, with grid configuration rather than generation build-out driving differentiation. EBAU’s improvements manifest not in generation composition but in reduced transmission congestion, improved asset utilization, and limited system cost savings. Emissions reductions and system cost improvements are modest, arising from improved grid utilization rather than structural transformation.\n\n**Core drivers:**\n\nEBAU varies from the BAU scenario through additional investments in existing transmission infrastructure.\n\n*Policy:* The scenario remains bound by pre-2035 national commitments. No new interconnection projects are introduced, but existing corridors are reinforced to allow greater bilateral trade.\n\n*Infrastructure and investment:* The scenario puts capital into transmission reinforcement rather than generation diversification, supporting grid reliability without requiring major technological shifts. The total estimated transmission investment of US$57 billion focuses exclusively on strengthening existing lines.\n\n*Technology cost and deployment:* The technology suite mirrors BAU, maintaining current technology shares. The model assumes static cost curves and conservative deployment limits for renewables.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThis scenario provides an intermediate benchmark for assessing policy and investment alignment under incremental infrastructure enhancement. It illustrates the benefits of optimizing current grid assets before embarking on large-scale interconnection. It is useful for understanding near-term market stability and the early benefits of improved interconnection.\n\nGiven the negligible divergence in generation outcomes across all TZ-APG scenarios, EBAU’s key analytical contribution lies in highlighting grid efficiency gains and their implications for system cost, rather than providing a distinct transition trajectory. It is therefore most relevant for assessing investment prioritization and asset utilization, not transition ambition.\n\nThe EBAU pathway provides capacity and generation data with limited time availability, providing only baseline 2023 and 2035 projections. It uses a moderately detailed breakdown by generation source, such as coal, solar, and wind. EBAU provides both regional and country-specific results, allowing granular comparisons for companies operating across multiple countries. TransitionZero offers open access to its underlying TZ-APG model, providing significantly greater detail and customizability for users who are interested in more complex applications.",
