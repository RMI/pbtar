  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Regional Interconnection (REGI) scenario marks the first major structural expansion of the ASEAN Power Grid in TransitionZero’s set of TZ-APG v1 pathways. It introduces new cross-border transmission projects identified under the ASEAN Interconnection Masterplan Study (AIMS III), including 18 interconnectors across the region and two additional subsea cables linking Singapore with Vietnam and Cambodia. These additions represent the backbone of a future interconnected ASEAN electricity market.\n\nWhile the model includes extensive new interconnection routes, the system-wide generation capacity and mix in 2035 remain nearly identical to BAU and EBAU. This reflects the TZ-APG model’s design emphasis on grid utilization and trade optimization rather than differential technology uptake. The scenario thus focuses on regional power flow patterns, investment costs, and trade efficiency rather than major shifts in generation technology.\n\nThe pathway demonstrates how regional coordination enhances flexibility, allowing countries to leverage resource complementarities. Integration also improves system utilization, reduces stranded-capacity risk, and slightly lowers system costs by avoiding redundant investment in domestic gas and storage. It reflects an ASEAN energy system beginning to function as a shared market rather than as a set of isolated national grids.\n\n#### Core Drivers\n\nREGI is driven by expanded investments in transmission, including regional interlinkages.\n\n*Policy:* Guided by the AIMS III framework, the scenario envisions member states implementing planned interconnectors by 2035. National generation targets continue to determine capacity development.\n\n*Infrastructure and investment:* Transmission expansion is the core feature of the REGI scenario. Investments focus on strategic corridors that enable high-volume trade, including Kalimantan–Sabah–Luzon and Laos–Thailand–Vietnam linkages. This pathway requires an estimated US$122 billion in new transmission investments to 2035.\n\n*Technology cost and deployment:* REGI is a cost-optimized model and maintains a balanced portfolio across coal, gas, hydro, and solar. No major technological shifts occur, but regional dispatch efficiency improves. The model reflects ongoing demand growth and industrialization across ASEAN, with regional integration serving as a mechanism to stabilize costs and reliability.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nThe Regional Interconnection scenario is best interpreted as an infrastructure-focused pathway rather than a low-carbon transition case. Given the negligible variance in capacity and generation values across scenarios, this scenario primarily provides insights into the economic and operational implications of ASEAN grid integration, including reduced investment duplication, enhanced regional trade, and cross-border policy coordination.\n\nFor transition assessments, this pathway is useful for analyzing how company strategies may align with or benefit from new transmission corridors, rather than for benchmarking emissions trajectories. It highlights how the physical expansion of interconnectors, despite stable generation structures, can reshape electricity trade and regional energy security outcomes. This scenario provides insights into operational dependencies on grid connectivity, informing resilience planning, investment in transmission-linked assets, and regional market positioning.\n\nThe REGI pathway provides capacity and generation data with limited time availability, providing only baseline 2023 and 2035 projections. It uses a moderately detailed breakdown by generation source, such as coal, solar, and wind. REGI provides both regional and country-specific results, allowing granular comparisons for companies operating across multiple countries. TransitionZero offers open access to its underlying TZ-APG model, providing significantly greater detail and customizability for users who are interested in more complex applications.",
