  "expertOverview": "#### Pathway Description\n\nThe Indonesia Super Grid (ISG) scenario represents the most ambitious grid expansion modeled by TransitionZero as part of the TZ-APG v1 set of pathways. It builds on the Regional Interconnection (REGI) configuration, incorporating four interisland transmission lines central to Indonesia’s national “Super Grid” plan. These links connect major islands such as Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi, enabling internal balancing and export potential.\n\nDespite this extensive build-out, the resulting total system capacity and generation in 2035 remains similar to those in the Business-as-Usual (BAU) and REGI scenarios. This reinforces that the model’s purpose is to test integration rather than to predict varying decarbonization speeds. ISG therefore represents the upper boundary of regional connectivity and system flexibility, not an accelerated low-carbon transition. \n\nThe ISG scenario serves as a technical exploration of Indonesia’s role as a regional electricity hub, testing how greater interisland and cross-border connectivity affects trade, storage optimization, and system efficiency without materially changing overall capacity growth rates. Integration improves system utilization, reduces stranded-capacity risk, and slightly lowers system costs by avoiding redundant investment in domestic gas and storage.\n\n**Core drivers:**\n\n*Policy:* ISG models the impact of Indonesia’s Super Grid initiative, combined with the targeted transmission build-out in the ASEAN Interconnection Masterplan Study (AIMS III) and the targeted generation build-outs of individual member states.\n\n*Infrastructure and investment:* The ISG pathway has the greatest investment in transmission infrastructure of any TransitionZero pathway, emphasizing intranational integration in combination with the regional interconnections included in the REGI pathway. It has the largest projected investment, with approximately US$124 billion invested in transmission through 2035 — more than double the BAU amount.\n\n*Technology cost and deployment:* ISG is a cost-optimized model and maintains a balanced portfolio across coal, gas, hydro, and solar. No major technological shifts occur, but regional dispatch efficiency improves. Sustained demand growth supports large-scale investment, while interconnection facilitates better utilization of renewable resources across islands.\n\n#### Application to Transition Assessment\n\nISG serves as an upper-bound scenario for understanding ASEAN’s potential under full grid integration. As the most extensive of the four pathways developed by TransitionZero, it provides a model for facilitating broader regional transmission via high rates of investment in transmission infrastructure, effective regional integration and cooperation, and supportive intranational grid build-outs.\n\nFor transition assessments, this pathway is useful for analyzing how company strategies may align with or benefit from new transmission corridors, rather than for benchmarking emissions trajectories. It helps identify opportunities linked to grid build-out — particularly in the context of Indonesia’s emerging role as a power exporter and regional balancing hub. ISG, along with REGI, highlights how the physical expansion of interconnectors, despite stable generation structures, can reshape electricity trade and regional energy security outcomes. This scenario provides insights into operational dependencies on grid connectivity, informing resilience planning, investment in transmission-linked assets, and regional market positioning.\n\nThe ISG pathway provides capacity and generation data with limited time availability, providing only baseline 2023 and 2035 projections. It uses a moderately detailed breakdown by generation source, such as coal, solar, and wind. ISG provides both regional and country-specific results, allowing granular comparisons for companies operating across multiple countries. Transition-Zero offers open access to its underlying TZ-APG model, providing significantly greater detail and customizability for users who are interested in more complex applications.",
