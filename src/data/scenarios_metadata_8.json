    "overview": "The Reactive Transition scenario assumes climate policies are delayed or diverge across countries and sectors. Sudden and unanticipated policies are introduced later to rapidly reduce emissions and meet climate goals. This leads to higher transition risks due to the unexpected nature of policy changes and limited time for adaptation. The scenario still limits warming to 2Â°C, but with higher economic costs than an orderly transition.",
    "expertRecommendation": "This scenario is particularly useful for stress testing and understanding potential financial stability implications of delayed climate action. It helps financial institutions identify potential vulnerabilities in their portfolios to sudden policy changes or technology shifts. We recommend using this scenario alongside more orderly scenarios to understand the range of potential transition pathways and associated risks. This scenario is especially relevant for financial institutions with exposure to carbon-intensive sectors that may face abrupt policy changes.",
