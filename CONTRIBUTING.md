## How to Contribute

### For External Contributors (Non-RMI Members)

- Make your changes.
- Open a PR from your fork and request review **only when your changes are ready**.
- A maintainer will review and merge your PR as appropriate.

### For RMI Organization Members (`write` privileges)

- Create a branch directly in the repository.
- Open a PR into `main` when ready.
- After your PR is approved, **merge it yourself**.

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Every pull request (PR) must contain at least one [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
  - Not all commits in the PR need to be conventional, but at least one is required.
  - This repo has an action set up to comment on PRs with the expected change log, and if there are no conventional commits, that comment will say so.
