## Running the application

1. Clone the Repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RMI/pbtar
cd pbtar
```

2. Create an `.env` file to store the desired frontend port

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Run the services with `docker compose`

```sh
# build the image
docker compose build

# run the container
docker compose up --detach

# do both
docker compose up --detach --build
```

The React web service will be accessible at http://localhost.

4. Shutdown the docker container

```sh
docker compose down
```

## Deployments

The application is deployed using Azure Static Web Apps:

- **Production**: [View Production Site](https://green-pebble-01f5d5c1e.6.azurestaticapps.net/)  
  _Deployed automatically when changes are merged to the `production` branch_

- **Development**: [View Development Site](https://green-pebble-01f5d5c1e-main.westus2.6.azurestaticapps.net/)  
  _Reflects the current state of the `main` branch_

Pull requests automatically deploy to preview environments with URLs provided in the PR comments.

## Development

### Set-Up

This project uses Node.js and npm for dependency management.

To install Node.js, follow the [official installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd pbtar
npm install
```

2. Running the Frontend
   You can locally serve the frontend _alone_ with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The local development service will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. It automatically reloads on file changes.

3. Running with `docker compose`
   If you prefer to run the entire application stack using Docker, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, including the frontend, backend, and database. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost`.

## Contributing

```

## Testing

This project uses Vitest for unit testing. To run the tests, use:
